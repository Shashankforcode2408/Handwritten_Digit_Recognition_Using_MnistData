# Handwritten_Digit_Recognition_Using_MnistData

This project aims to demonstrate a machine learning model for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision.

# Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately recognize handwritten digits from images. The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, with each image being a grayscale 28x28 pixel image of a handwritten digit from 0 to 9.

The model is built using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which is known to perform well on image classification tasks. The model is trained on the training dataset and then evaluated on the testing dataset to measure its performance.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates a machine learning model for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. By training a convolutional neural network on the dataset, the model achieves accurate predictions of handwritten digits. Feel free to explore and modify the code to further improve the model's performance or apply it to other image recognition tasks.
